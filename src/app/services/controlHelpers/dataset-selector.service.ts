dataset hierarchy:
classification (rainfall, temp, etc)
- date range: user selected, valid range controlled by classification (encompassing all available datasets for classification)
-- datasets: set of subclassifications, their set info, date ranges they cover

have datasets be auto selected based on date range, with hybrids used for ranges that cover multiple
provide description of dataset(s) being used and the time ranges they exist for, and allow user to select order of preference of datasets (allows for expansion to more than 2 subclasses)
dataset with highest preference that includes data for a given date will be used

have service determine dataset to be used, this will construct a set of properties to be used in query... make sure to also integrate into caching system

new control type, ordered list, draggable elements
cdkDropList around a set of cdkDrag

note category select, date range select, and dataset precedence selector (if hybrid) are global (should be available for all datasets), rest of controls and info are based on Dataset info

//no, because need some sort of function based on date to get actual resource location, just have classifications of export items and have query info generated by service that handles that stuff
//just make sure you have a handler for each of the types, would have needed to add that anyway
//this is just a set of tags that identify which handler you'll need to use
//in whatever service using to do actual export logic it should have a mapping of these tags along with date and classification/subclassification and determine how to retreive resource
//same with display stuff, don't have the query logic here, this should just tag what items should be retrieved
//NOTE THAT YOULL NEED TO ADD CAVEAT TO DOWNLOAD PACKAGE STUFF THAT NOT ALL DATA MIGHT BE THERE, ADD LOGIC TO DISPLAY NOTHING IF AN ITEM ISNT RETREIVED (e.g. if not retreiving rainfall station data)
//also need other information on what data to use, what is to be selected by users, what is bound between display and export options and what is separately selected by export
//"display" options are logically first, and any data with same tag shares any dataset selection properties with same export tag, so have "bound" flag to indicate implicit carryover
//use any selected display data to seed export data if not bound
//e.g. for fill type have it unbound (user can select multiples for export), but seed export by having selected display fill type initially selected
